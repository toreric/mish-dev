  findHelp3: "<span>1</span>. Do mark that <span>all to be found...</span> and then write in the text box above, for example (blue marked):
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>nils jacobss</span> (two search terms) finds all images with the text ’Nils Jacobsson’ but also other images with both ’Nils’ and ’Jacobss’ in the text, for example ’Nils Jonasson and Bertil Jacobsson’.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>nils%jacobs</span> (one search term) finds images with, for example ’Nils Jacobsson’ or ’Nils Jacobsen’."
  findHelp4: "<span>2</span>. Do mark that <span>at least one of them must be found...</span> and write, for example:
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>nils jacobss</span> (two search terms) finds all images with the text ’Nils Jacobsson’ and also all images with any of ’Nils’ or ’Jacobss’ in the text, for example ’Fredrik Nilson’ and/or ’Filip Jacobsson’ (but not ’Nisse Jacobson’).<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>nils%jacobs</span> (one search term) finds images with, for example ’Nils Jacobsson’ or ’Nils Jacobsen’ (same as <span>1</span>, since only one search term)."
  findHelp5: Write what you want to search for in the box at the top and start the search. The result is presented in an album for temporary use called <b>Found images</b> with a link to the original in each thumbnail's menu. <span style="color:#0b0;text-decoration:underline">Green border below the caption</span> means linked image.
